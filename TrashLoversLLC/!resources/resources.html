<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p>We take trash and turn it into treasures... or at least we try! Here are some frequently asked questions to help you understand our subscription services, trust us we have heard everything. Rest assured, we've got your garbage handled—no matter which tier you choose!</p>

    <summary>What does the appraisal service include?</summary>
      <p> A: For our Trash Fanatic Package, we'll appraise up to 2 lbs of your trash—anything over that comes with a small handling fee.
        Garbage Pro Members can appraise up to 10 lbs without extra charges. As an Ultimate Dumpster VIP Fire+ member, you enjoy unlimited appraisals by weight,
         but we kindly limit you to 40 lbs per day for quality assurance.<br>
         Rest assured, our experts take pride in determining your trash's hidden value (if any).</p>

    <summary>What happens to the trash after you take it?</summary>
      <p> A: That's a great question. We process trash through a combination of recycling, selling, and mysterious internal selling methods. Let's just say it all goes to “good use.” (Definetely not being sold to other people for profit)</p>
